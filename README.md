# expo-library
A React Native application built using Expo to model a simple Library app.

This app was created with Expo CLI using the `expo-template-tabs`. 

## Running the App

In the command line, inside the `expo-library` directory, enter the following:

`npm install` - Install project dependencies

`npm start` - Opens the Metro Bundler page on Chrome. From here, you can run different simulators and find a QR code to run on a device.

### Using a Simulator

Running your app on a simulator is easy. Simply click on "Run on iOS simulator" on the Metro Bundler page that opens when you run `npm start`. 

### Using a Device

If you have a device you'd like to use for testing, Expo provides an excellent tool called [Expo Client](https://expo.io/tools#client). Expo Client is an app you can download from the AppStore that runs apps built using Expo. The only requirement is that your machine running the Metro Bundler page on Chrome is on the same WiFi network as your mobile device. 

Once you've downloaded the Expo Client app on your device, open the Camera app. Point the camera at the QR code, and tap on the banner notification from the Expo app at the top of your screen.
